# Cinnamon-Silk-Theme
My custom green theme for **Linux Mint 21** - Cinnamon based on Silk and Windows 10 Dark.
It's a theme with green Windows 10/11 style window borders and transparency.

## To replicate the full desktop experience
You'll need to add [`Papirus-Dark` icon theme](https://github.com/PapirusDevelopmentTeam/papirus-icon-theme) and [`S1mple-Breeze-Snow` cursor theme](https://www.cinnamon-look.org/p/1405210).
